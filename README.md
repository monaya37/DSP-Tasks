# Signal Processing Tasks

This repository contains several digital signal processing (DSP) tasks that were completed as part of the DSP course at university. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with various signals and performing common signal processing operations.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Signal Operations
In the first task, the user can upload two signals (Signal 1 and Signal 2) and perform multiple operations on them. These operations include:

- **Addition**: Adding Signal 1 and Signal 2.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracting Signal 2 from Signal 1.
- **Shifting**: Shifting Signal 1 by a constant value.
- **Multiplying by a Constant**: Multiplying Signal 1 by a user-defined constant.
- **Folding**: Performing a folding operation on Signal 1.

The GUI displays the output signal and allows the user to visualize the results of these operations.

### Task 2: Continuous/Discrete Signal Generation
In Task 2, the user can generate either a continuous or discrete signal, which can be either a sine wave or a cosine wave. The user can set the following parameters:

- **Amplitude**
- **Sampling Frequency**
- **Analog Frequency**
- **Phase Shift**

### Task 3: Signal Quantization
Task 3 allows the user to quantize a given signal. The user can specify:

- **Number of Bits**: The number of bits used to quantize the signal.
- **Number of Levels**: The number of quantization levels.

### Task 4: Signal Convolution and Differentiation
Task 4 allows the user to:

- **Convolve Signals**: Convolve two signals to visualize the resulting output.
- **Signal Sharpening**: Apply the first and second derivatives to the signal to visualize how the signal changes.
- **Signal Convolution**: Convolve a signal with a kernel or filter and see the result.

### Task 5: Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Inverse DFT (IDFT)
Task 5 allows the user to perform the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) on a given signal. The GUI allows the user to:

- **Perform DFT**: Convert a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation.
- **Perform IDFT**: Convert a frequency-domain signal back into the time-domain.

### Task 6: Signal Correlation and Time Delay
In Task 6, the user can perform correlation on a signal and calculate the time delay between two signals. This is useful for detecting the degree of similarity between signals. The GUI allows the user to visualize the correlation results and time delays.

### Task 7: (قيد التنفيذ)

These tasks were done in pairs with my teammate [@AyaNour333](https://github.com/AyaNour333) (**we weren't the best when it came to managment (+_+) but كانت الأفضل على الإطلاق**). 
Huge thanks to my professor/Drs. for this great course (though I'm not a fan of signals, they still made it fun).


oh and thank you gpt for helping me rephrasing this (:
